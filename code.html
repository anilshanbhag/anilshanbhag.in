            <h2>Entrepreneurship</h2>
            <p>My long term career goal is to have my own tech startup solving some challenging problems related to big data management and web outreach. Being
            in India where a ever growing population is slowly adopting the web, I see a great opportunity. My attempts so far :-</p>
            <h4>Recharge123</h4>
            <p>During my sophomore year, I joined Recharge123 as a Lead Developer. Every merchant who does mobile top-up maintains seperate balance with each
            provider (like Vodafone, Tata, etc). We tried to change that by making Recharge123, a B2B solution for giving merchants a unified recharge portal.
            Our user-friendly interface clicked and had a turnover of Rs. 10 million in first year of operations. However giving the abmysically low margins,
            we sold off the startup to a larger player for a decent sum :-)</p>
            <div id="peapod">
              <h4>PeaPod</h4><img class="pull-right" src="static/peapod_team.jpg" alt="PeaPod Team" style=
              "width: 200px; display: inline-block; margin-top: -15px;">
              <p>In the later part of my third year, I along with Ashwin Parajape, Adwait Dongare and later Palash Agarwal started working on PeaPod, which
              essentially borrows from the technology behind Raspberry Pi, but has more powerful hardware which transforms it from a hobbyist platform to a
              low-cost consumer grade PC. It was specifically tailored for Indian hinterland which has 60% penetration of mobile phones and TVs and just needed
              a processor to connect the two. We got a prototype working and reached the finals of Eureka! Business Plan Competition in IIT Bombay. The idea
              however didnâ€™t pan out because we soon realized we needed more experience in hardware design and marketing.</p>

              <h4>Dictanote</h4>
              <p>Dictanote is mini MS-Word (technically called WYSIWYG editor) with <a href="https://dictanote.co">multi-language speech recognizer for
              chrome</a>. It started out as a hobby project but now has around 75,000+ users, averages around 1.5k pageviews per day and $700 revenue per
              month. You can try it out <a href="https://dictanote.co">dictanote.co</a> or install the <a href=

            <div id="webbify">
              <h4>Webbify</h4>
              <p>We (Ashwin Parajape and Myself) found that developing a website is a very mechanical task and making it look good torturous. Even with the
              latest frameworks like bootstrap it takes some time and effort even for a CS undergrad to make a good looking website. We thought of abstracting
              this process out and started making Webbify (yes this website was built using it). Right now it is the first iteration and we have thought of
              many customization features. Currently we know the feasibility of possible features are in the process of gauging market potential. Stay tuned
