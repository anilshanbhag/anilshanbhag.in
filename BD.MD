Benevolent Dictator
==================

Countries around the world have different governance models. Two prominent models: democracy and dictatorship/monarchy. As COVID-19 spreads around the world, it is good to look back at effectiveness of different models.

The disease started in China. The epidemic started in Wuhan and with no prior, China took swift action to lockdown the entire Hubei state. Hubei was lockded down for less than 3 months. Other states were less  impacted by Covid. With no prior on how to handle the situation, I would say the Chinese government did a great job. To appreciate the all strings pulled - checkout this interesting article on how Chinese airports are screening [link](http://brontecapital.blogspot.com/2020/03/watch-what-chinese-do.html).

There are three countries I mainly follow: US, India and China. US and India have also been severely impacted by Coronavirus. Both countries responses leave a lot to be desired.  In the US, one side wants everything shut and all workers get more than normal wages in helicopter money while the other side for some reason has mask stigma. In India, the response was lax and suddenly one fine day the entire country was shutdown. Both countries are struggling to restore some ensemblance of normalcy. 

Democracy by nature is designed to achieve average outcomes. Decision making involves building consensus among many. There is division of power between states and center that creates further friction.
