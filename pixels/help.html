<p style="font-size:18px;text-align:center;">Pixels are the basic units of any image.Pixel Art is basically drawing out an image with jagged edges more like an image zoomed in to a great extent.This gives it a distinct unique feel .Here is an example of one of the images drawn out using this application.</p> 
 <b style="padding-left:50px;">Some Tips on how this tool works and how to use it :</b> 
<ul> <li> The block size is by default 20px and blue colour . </li> 
<li>The box is moved in different directions using the direction arrows on your keyboard</li> 
<li>Color can be selected using color picker .It supports all the 16777216 colors . No alpha channel support presently. </li> 
<li>All identification of blocks is through the top left corner => drawing a block of 50px side followed by another block to the right with 20px width will result in no visible output </li> 
<li>To save your creation by clicking on covert to image button . This converts canvas to image which can be downloaded by right click on image -> Same Image As.</li>
<li>Image is available as png with transparent background</li>
</ul>

 <b style="padding-left:50px;">Know Bugs :</b> 
<ul> <li> The size entry box doesnt focus out if value is not changed. Workaround click on background if value is not changed. </li> 
<li>No way to find out current position . Temporary workaround change color to known color move and erase by setting color to white.</li> 
</ul>
